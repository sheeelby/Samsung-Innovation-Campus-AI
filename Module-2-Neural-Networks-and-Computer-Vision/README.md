# Module 2: Neural Networks and Computer Vision

- Getting to know the **PyTorch** library.
- Building a neural network: architecture, training, optimization of neural networks. BackProp.
- Solving classification problems using neural networks: **softmax, binary cross-entropy**. Localization, detection, segmentation and super-resolution.
- **CNN: LeNet(1998), AlexNet(2012), VGG(2014), GoogLeNet, ResNet(2015).**
- The maximum likelihood method. Transfer learning using the example of a kaggle competition.

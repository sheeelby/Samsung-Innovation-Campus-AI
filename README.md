Starting with the basics of classical machine learning, you will move on to studying various neural network architectures for machine vision and natural language text processing tasks. Practical tasks with auto-verification and competitions on the Kaggle platform are waiting for you. To get started, you need a little higher mathematics and basic knowledge of the Python language.
The course is available to students of partner universities of the Samsung Innovation Campus project.
